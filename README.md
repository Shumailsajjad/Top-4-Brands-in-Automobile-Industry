# Top-4-Brands-in-Automobile-Industry
## Econometrics Project

In the realm of the "market for lemons," where sellers possess better information than buyers about the quality of goods, such as used cars, I examined how this phenomenon manifests in Pakistan. Through this project, I sought to understand the variation in market prices between used and new cars across the top four automobile brands in the country and the factors influencing these prices.

## Dataset Description:

The dataset comprises 24,973 rows and 8 columns, offering insights into various attributes of cars. Here's a brief overview of the features:

- **Brand:** The make or brand of the car.
- **Condition:** The condition of the car (e.g., new, used).
- **KMs Driven:** Total kilometers driven by the car.
- **Model:** The model of the car.
- **Price:** The price of the car.
- **Registered City:** The city where the car is registered.
- **Transaction Type:** The type of transaction (e.g., cash, finance).
- **Year:** The year of manufacture of the car.

These attributes encompass physical characteristics and transactional details, offering valuable insights into the automobile market dynamics.

## Files:

- **Car_Data.csv:** Dataset containing car information in CSV format (encoding='ISO-8859-1').
- **Code.do:** Stata code for analyzing the research question and generating relevant visualizations.
- **Findings and Summary.pdf:** Research paper presenting a comprehensive overview of the project findings.

This repository provides a detailed exploration of the automobile industry in Pakistan, focusing on the market dynamics of the top four brands and sheds light on the interplay between car condition, price, and other factors influencing the market.
