# Top-4-Brands-in-Automobile-Industry
Econometrics Project

### A substantial portion of my research has also been dedicated to quantitative methods and studies. In this project, I applied a quantitative approach to analyze how the price dynamics vary across used and new cars in the top 4 automobile brands in Pakistan. I used Stata software to study a multivariate regression that determined the correlation between the price of a vehicle and its brandâ€™s market surplus and positioning. This study brought about a lot of important use cases, e.g., the decision-making of cars within households, the impact of inflation on consumer choices, and policy outcomes that can be beneficial both for the industry and people buying automobiles from diverse economic backgrounds. Currently, I am working on measuring how recent economic shocks such as COVID-19 have fragmented these automobile brands internally. The initial results are promising, as the stagflation in our economy has brought about a higher increase in the market value of used cars relative to new ones.
